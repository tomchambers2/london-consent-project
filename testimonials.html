                "Kate and Victoria visited Colfe's School in London to deliver workshops with our Year 11 students on the legal issues surrounding sex and consent. From a Personal, Social, Health and Economic Education viewpoint this was completely refreshing and new to our students, as for the most part Sex Education was primarily biology based. They were professional yet approachable in their delivery and even the quietest of students was able to engage and interact with all aspects of the workshop. The laws and case studies they discussed were utterly thought-provoking: in an era where we can not afford to tiptoe around the subject of rape and consent, the real-life cases completely resonated with the students and teachers observing. The sessions hopefully taught girls and boys alike the confidence to say no, the importance of listening to their partner and - something I hope they never need to know - where and what to do if something happens to them. I would highly recommend Kate and Victoria to all schools and educational institutions as with the current dangers of social media, readily available pornography and simple ignorance, Sex Education must be refreshed and revamped and this is definitely the way forward.”

              <div class="bubble three left">“It was periods 5 and 6 in which students are usually tired and find hard to concentrate for a long period of time. I did not see that throughout the 2 periods. All or most of the students were engaged at all times. The type of language you used was appropriate for their age and […] your presentation was extremely clear and very well organised. What make it so successful in my own eyes was the way you made students part of your presentation, creating time [and] games for them to express themselves [in] without being afraid to do so.”</div>
