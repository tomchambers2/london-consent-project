            <h1>The London Consent Project is a not-for-profit, lawyer-run initiative, which provides one hour workshops in schools for both boys and girls to explore the legal framework surrounding sexual offences and consent.</h1>

            	<li><b>96%</b> of students felt that the workshop hosts (hyperlink to ‘Who We Are’) responded well to their questions</li>
            </ul>
            <small>*statistics based on a survey of 49 students</small>

            <h1>WHAT WE DO</h1>
            <p>The workshops tackle key misconceptions about non-consensual sexual activity as represented in mainstream media, they pressure-test existing prejudices through a series of "rape myths", encourage students to explore the legal definitions of consent and certain key sex offences, explore how consent can be 'checked' with future sexual partners, and empower students to identify instances where sexual activity crosses the line from legal to illegal.</p>

            <p>The aim of the London Consent Project is to foster a culture in which consent is never taken for granted and younger generations feel comfortable identifying, articulating or withholding their consent to sexual activity. We want to normalise the ‘consent conversation’ so that it is no longer overlooked or assumed. Current school curricula address sex from a purely biological standpoint, and we believe that sex education today urgently needs to be located within a legal and relational context.</p>
