                        <p><i>I am outraged by the number of friends who have experienced casual sexual violence first-hand. It was this outrage that, in November 2014, prompted me to found the London Consent Project, so that our cultural normalisation of sexual offences is not accidentally inherited by the next generation.</i></p>
                        <p><i>As a lawyer, I want to use my own training to educate and empower students from a legal perspective. It is important that they understand the legal thresholds in this area so that they can identify and call-out behaviour which crosses these lines. But I also want to raise the concept of ‘consent’ in general. I want students to feel comfortable asking for consent and verbalising their own consent. I want consent to be actively discussed both inside and outside the classroom. I want students to become more critically engaged with consent culture in the press, in social media, and in their daily interactions.</i></p>

                      <p><i>Consent urgently needs to be talked about. For decades, educational establishments have left this conversation to parents, communities and to young people to have amongst themselves. Having witnessed with outrage and helplessness the effects of sexual assault on two close friends, I am firmly committed to educating young people about consent so that they are better able to assert themselves and protect and support one another.</i></p>
