            <p>
              The <a href="http://notguiltycampaign.co.uk/">#NotGuilty Campaign</a> is a national campaign against sexual violence and victim-blaming that was set up by Ione Wells and the student newspaper at Oxford University, Cherwell. The campaign seeks to encourage survivors of assault to feel supported and able to speak out and get help, and to emphasise the solidarity of community needed to combat sexual violence. It stresses that no survivor should feel alone, and that no survivor should be blamed for the abuse that they suffered. <a href="http://notguiltycampaign.co.uk/">#NotGuilty</a> runs a variety of projects: talks, articles and panel events across the country to raise awareness of these issues, survivor support groups, educational schemes and workshops, and a community on the <a href="http://notguiltycampaign.co.uk/">#NotGuilty</a> website called the 'Shared Stories' project - allowing individuals to speak out about their experiences. By laying an emphasis on hearing from survivors themselves, the campaign hopes not only to prove that no survivor should feel silenced by society, but also to send a clear message that sexual abuse has a devastating impact that we cannot tolerate and urgently need to counter.
