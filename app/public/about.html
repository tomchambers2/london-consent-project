            <h1>WHAT WE DO</h1>

            <p>The London Consent Project aims to equip middle and senior school students with a basic legal knowledge of sexual offences and consent, so that they can navigate sexual encounters with greater confidence and clarity.</p>
            <p>The workshops tackle key misconceptions about non-consensual sexual activity as represented in mainstream media, they pressure-test existing prejudices through a series of "rape myths", encourage students to explore the legal definitions of consent and certain key sex offences, explore how consent can be 'checked' with future sexual partners, and empower students to identify instances where sexual activity crosses the line from legal to illegal.</p>
            <p>The aim of the London Consent Project is to foster a culture in which consent is never taken for granted and younger generations feel comfortable identifying, articulating or withholding their consent to sexual activity. We want to normalise the ‘consent conversation’ so that it is no longer overlooked or assumed. Current school curricula address sex from a purely biological standpoint, and we believe that sex education today urgently needs to be located within a legal and relational context.</p>

                  <p><i>“I am outraged by the number of friends who have experienced casual sexual violence first-hand. It was this outrage that, in November 2014, prompted me to found the London Consent Project, so that our cultural normalisation of sexual offences is not accidentally inherited by the next generation.</i></p>
                  <p><i>As a lawyer, I want to use my own training to educate and empower students from a legal perspective. It is important that they understand the legal thresholds in this area so that they can identify and call-out behaviour which crosses these lines. But I also want to raise the concept of ‘consent’ in general. I want students to feel comfortable asking for consent and verbalising their own consent. I want consent to be actively discussed both inside and outside the classroom. I want students to become more critically engaged with consent culture in the press, in social media, and in their daily interactions”</i></p>
                  <p>Kate read English at Gonville &amp; Caius College, Cambridge. She was called to the Bar in July 2014, and begins her pupillage at a criminal chambers later this year.</p>

                  <p><i>“Consent urgently needs to be talked about. For decades, educational establishments have left this conversation to parents, communities and to young people to have amongst themselves. Having witnessed with outrage and helplessness the effects of sexual assault on two close friends, I am firmly committed to educating young people about consent so that they are better able to assert themselves and protect and support one another.”</i></p>

She went on to complete the Bar Practitioners Training Course at Kaplan Law School, and is currently working at a business crime firm in London.</p>
